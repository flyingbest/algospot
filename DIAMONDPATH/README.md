# Dynamic Programming(DP)

- In mathematics, compter science, economics, and bioinformatics, dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems.

- It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substucture (described below).
	When applicable, the method take far less time than other methods that don't take advantage of the subproblem overlap (like depth-first search).
